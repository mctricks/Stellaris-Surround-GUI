# Stellaris-Surround-GUI

This is a mod for the video game Stellaris.

When playing the game with multi-monitor tools like NVIDIA Surround, the GUI will stretch itself accross all monitors.
This makes the player have to constantly turn their head to see the GUI elements, as most elements in this game are bound to 
either the left or right side of the screen.

This mod essentially changes the UI to be bound to the inner edges of the monitors instead of the outer edges. This is to make use of the extra monitor space, without all of the head turning. That way you get all the awesomness of NVIDIA surround, with none
of the pain of GUI all over the place. (This is Version 2).

This was created for three 1080p monitors using NVIDIA Surround, with a 42 pixel bezel between each monitor (5844 x 1080). 

To install this mod, simply copy-paste the files in the mod's Stellaris folder to their corresponding folders in the actual installation folder.

You may want to make a backup of these files if you intend on switching back and forth between surround and standard.

I may or may not create a tool to set a custom bezel size, and toggle the mod on and off depending on public interest.

KNOWN ISSUE: There's no way I've found to have the left bar be expandable and have it look right, so I've modified the files to only work as the unexpanded version. You will need to lock your sidebar for it to work right.

I have left the original version (Version 1) available, which puts all the UI elements on the main monitor, and does not require Dark UI to look right.
